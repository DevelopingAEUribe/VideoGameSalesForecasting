A data-driven analysis of global video game sales using historical data to identify trends, evaluate user behavior, and generate strategic marketing recommendations for a 2017 campaign.

##  Project Overview

In this project, I acted as a data analyst for a global video game retailer to explore the factors driving successful game performance across different platforms, genres, and regions. Using a dataset containing sales figures, user and critic scores, ESRB ratings, and platform metadata, I applied exploratory data analysis and statistical testing to uncover actionable insights.

The primary business goal was to forecast sales patterns and identify opportunities for platform prioritization and regional marketing strategy.
